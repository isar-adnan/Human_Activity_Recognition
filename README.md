ii. Extract the dataset file.

iii. Put the notebook file in the same folder where the data file has been extracted. Or the path can be changed in the code as per custom need.

iv. Download the separatetraintest.zip from this repository and extract in the same folder where the data files are available.

v. Run the code blocks of the notebook file sequentially

vi. Extract the"checkVideo.zip" in the same folder where the notebook file is available. This folder contains completely new videos that are neither in train nor in test folders. These videos can be used to test the code. To test with any of videos, the following statement at the last block of notebook file needs to be updated/changes. video_name = 'checkVideo/Horse_Riding.avi' Just need to put a new video in the checkVideo folder and update the video file name in the above statement to test with a new video.
